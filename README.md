## about/challange

I bit challanged about when I read some instruction how should I put code from JavaScript. I asked patrick he helped me **let** of code is valuble. Also, how I can make it bob is before and after bob is random person. Also, Particke told me "don't forget the spelling Eorrors when I do JavaScript with console."

### What I used JavaScript:

```
// Declare a variable with a name of your choice
let randomName;

// Assign this variable a value of your choice.
randomName = "Bob";

// Print the variable (Before) with console.log.
console.log("Before:", randomName);

// Print the the variable again (After), but changed in some way.
console.log("After:", `${randomName} is a random person`);
```
